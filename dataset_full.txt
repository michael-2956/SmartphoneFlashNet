Test and report the gsi volte
47
It doesn't matter what projects people like or dislike. It's all about open source work. If any dev does open source work, devs from other projects can benefit from it. Every dev keeps driving development forwards. Users of every rom can benefit from other project devs work.

By the way how long you've been without phone?

I know Android is Apache Licence and not GPL but even in GPL you would be totally allowed to sell other devs work according to the licence. As I said, free in free software doesn't mean the same as in free beer but as in free speech. Everyone is allowed to use and modify it like he wants to.

Just take that from any flashable zip. Not not sure, but try

Which vendor?

But genreally its frowned upon in the community. Ubuntu got a lot of stick for preinstalling some amazon software. Zorin OS is disliked because it has a paid version. Manjaro has preinstalled Steam and Office, and the Arch community hates it.

Is that ur meme
83
yea, I know idiots are everywhere. People seem to not understand how licencing works. If someone works on a software under a certain licence and decides to keep the licence if he has a choice or decides to use the licence if there is no way of changing it (like with GPL), there is no reason to complain when someone uses his code according to the licence he choose. Choosing a licence and complaining when people work according to it is just... dumb.
3
no it's not
10
Is there any fix for messenger voice recording on oop
16
Apache Licence is even permissive. People don't have to distribute their modifications under the same licence.
4
Use gcam port hub
14
Android devs are totally free to choose another licence that maybe doesn't allow monetizing.
2
Idk man
9
But usually they just keep it... and complain afterwards

how to enable rewind tab on stories?
14
Personally for my work I like using the "Don't be a Dick Public Licence"
7
which doesn't allow monetizing of unmodified work
16
" 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick."
2
What phone?
11
also, very important point in the licence for the android community:
33
"3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back."

This is the best sound I've ever experienced on Xiaomi devices. The sound is pretty good with my Marshall Major. Ofc it's better with Viper, but stock is usable as well.

If you're coming from any other ROM, including stock, make sure you remove your PIN/Password/Pattern before installation. (use /notes command to get available links) 1. Boot into Official TWRP. 2. Wipe dalvik, system and data. 3. Flash LOS build. 4. Reboot to bootloader and boot into recovery again. 5. Then flash OpenGApps(nano preferred) 6. Boot into system. Done 7. Flash magisk 17.1 or later version(only after booting into system)(optional)
12
No.. extract that zip and u will find adb folder inside it

Great news from CosmicDan: I'm in the process of updating for Pie 4.9 kernels/ROM's. It will be based on the latest official TWRP device tree (full credits to nicknitewolf) and official TWRP build system, so I'll need to look into if it has any issues or quirks that I'll need to address (I'll scour the thread) since the current TWRP is based on a mutilated RR device tree Stay tuned.

So what's your problen
58
When you're inputting SSID you're using the normal keyboard with prediction turned on. Whereas when you input password you're typing on a secure keyboard which doesn't allow text prediction and copy paste. So if you want to paste into secure field you may try some other keyboard app, maybe Hacker's Keyboard. However I'm not sure of it'll work.

Stop asking for the best ROMs/Kernels (for battery, for performance or any other criteria), it doesn't exist. If there was one true best ROM/Kernel, do you think there would be other ROMs or Kernels? There's only subjectively best and that's different for everyone. Everyone has different usage patterns & preferences, so when asking for the best, you get the best for them, not the best for you. The only way you'll find the best one for you is by trying them yourself. They're all free, anyway. BEST IS SUBJECTIVE.

If you wipe dalvik you get slow app opening. Leave it a week and apps start to respond faster as the dalvik starts to rebuild. Shouldn't take so long but for me it takes thaaaat long which sucks

Oh you remember nice Yes hi nubs
45
It won't solve the issue. 1) Don't clear apps from recents (let apps be cached. Its completely harmless) 2) don't use ram cleaner 3) tweak animation duration from developer options 4) Set LMK in kernel manager very light I'm sure your device will work faster.

Fuck, I don't give a fuck about you, listen to me. I don't give a fuck about your fucking car, your apartments, your fucking shit, your yachts, everything - I don't give a fuck about it. I don't give a fuck about a fuckin' Bentley, a fuckin' Rolls-Royce, or a fuckin' 100-meter yacht, you know? How many fucking women you are, how many fucking women you are, what do you mean by these fucking chic or satinworms you're going to space - I don't give a shit about it, you know? I've been so fucking fulfilled in my knowledge that it's like I've been living on trillions and trillions of fucking planets for a hundred trillion fucking years, you know? Like this Earth. I already have an absolute understanding of the world, and here I am looking for just one fucking thing: peace, tranquillity and this harmony from the fusion with the infinitely eternal. From contemplation of this great fractal resemblance and from this wonderful unity of the infinite eternal being - wherever you look: even though in the depths - infinitely small, even upwards - infinitely large, you understand? And you and yours again with it there. Go further, your distribution is your way and your horizon of knowledge, feeling and your nature. And it is incommensurably shallow compared to mine, you know? It's as if I'm already a deep old man immortal or almost immortal, who is on this planet from its very beginning, when the sun has just formed like a star and this is a gas and dust cloud ... after the explosion of the Sun, when it broke out like a star and began to form conservative planets, you know? I've been on this Earth for five billion fucking years, living and knowing it all over the world. And you're some of these people for me. I don't give a fuck about your cars, your fucking yachts, your apartments there, for your benefit, you know? I've been on this planet or an infinite multitude and cooler than Caesar, and cooler than fucking Hitler and cooler than all the greats, you know? And somewhere he was a complete shit, even worse than here. Because I feel a lot of these states. Somewhere I was more like a plant, somewhere more like a bird, a worm. Somewhere there was just a bunch of stone. It's all a soul, you know? It has the facets of a completely diverse, infinite variety. But you don't understand it, so you go to your fucking place. We live in this world with different feelings, different aspirations. Accordingly, our place and ours are different, our distribution is different. I wish you to have all the coolest cars and all the best females, to have your legs spread out there, to have all the fucking cracks in your face like a carpet was opened and molested. And you fucked them till they were blue, red as the sunset. So that on the best yachts, on planes he would fly and come straight from the window and everything that could come to mind or not. If you don't have enough ideas, I'll give you hundreds of trillion more ideas on what to do. Well, what about me? I am walking like a deep old man who has seen the eternal, touched the divine, has become like a god himself and is eager to do it endlessly. Who is at peace, at peace, in harmony, in grace, in this innermost bliss abides, involved in everything and in everything, you know? That's all. This is our difference, so to speak. I go to admire the universe, and you go to be filled with something in the facets of some. That's the difference, you know? You do not see this eternal infinite, you do not need it. But you are, so to speak, more active, as this woodpecker or an ant, who is very active in his path, that's all. So let's just say that our paths here, so to speak, are similar, of course, because everything is the same, but you are me... I understand you very well, but you hardly do, because as if I were you, you, and as if I kept you inside, all your nature. It makes up one little grain of sand from what's in me, you know? That's all it is. So go ahead, go ahead, and I'm going to enjoy the fucking beautiful fucking autumn sunset on the banks of the warm southern river. @multifeed_edge_bot

!tmute 1d you are spamming. i checked your history. you are going off topic often and flooding the group a lot with one word ot messages. if i see even a single ot word from you next time. there won't be any warning. it will be permanent ban. so stay on topic after your tmute is lifted after 24hrs. if you send pm and ask for thsi tem mute to be removed i will just add warns for all your previous messages. and they will be lead to like 10+ warns( 3 warns lead to ban) so you pick now, either this temp 1 day mute and then stay on topic OR send PM saying this 24hr mute is not justicfied and i will do justice by adding all your pending warns.

Hi sir I'm new here, a few questions for you. 1. I want to flash nougat, I have read in instructions that I need to flash 3 firmwares before the ROM. Is this wrong or just flash any of the 3? 2. Recommended nougat ROM for battery/stability. I have downloaded PA, AOSiP & Cardinal (haven't found Carbon). Still have 60hrs unlock. I hope you could help me. Than you.

It fixes zygote on a-only devices. Basically, if your device is a-only, you can't boot without it. If you have an a/b or sar device... Then ignore it

8
Artem sar, I need to ask you something
7
Compatible with the majority of devices https://botsup.me/
9
Artem sar, I need to ask you something @multifeed_edge_bot
21
Maybe, The Developer stoped update, because the update from miui doesn't really matter, and they will back on Miui 11. Cmiiw
4
I don't know actually
1
#flymedatafix
16
Miui masks the network indicator. The refresh rate is reduced and indian standard value is implemented.
12
Aosp network indicator uses global standards and ha SA higher refresh rate.

1. First, ask yourself: is there really a problem here? 2. Accept it. 3. Use 80 percent of your time to find solutions. 4. Break the problem down into smaller pieces. 5. Find the opportunity and/or lesson within the problem.

Let ur phone drain to 10%, fully charged it without interrupting, keep charger plugged in once fully charged, download root essentials from play store, give it root access, click on battery calibration and click calibrate battery, now unplug charger. It is the best to let it drain to 10% then fully charge it again. Done

When you success flashing twrp, try reboot manual press vol+power and install lazy flasher

That's good, there's no issues, but there may be sometimes, clean flash is to avoid them

Yes. @multifeed_edge_bot

Yes.

Do you have Chinese mido or global mido

You are lucky, I had to remotely resurrect a mido the other day.. a guy pushed so hard, that he extracted the scrip from this zip, rewrote it and removed the hardware check and flashed a markw ROM on a mido.. was a bit hard to make it work again..

Hello , I have a feature suggestion. If we put the app to background for some time say 5-6 minutes, it refreshes the feed and we would need to scroll back to reach to the particular post. So can we please have a feature to disable auto refresh like Twitter app, on Twitter doesn't matter if you open the app after a week, it doesn't auto-refreshes the content. Thank you.

I thought - since it's easily available even with a 3sec Google search - it is not really recommended to pin it or include it in /notes
32
Try again but do not need to use "fastboot boot twrp" just manually reboot to twrp using the vol + power button and if you have entered twrp please install lazy flasher
11
It's not something you'll find easily that's why I said that
